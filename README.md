**VoidRunner** is a personal 5th-year project developed using my **custom 3D engine** with **SDL** and **OpenGL**, focusing on creating a space-themed game. 

Key features implemented include a responsive **spaceship flying system**, **asteroid field generation**, and an advanced **AI state machine** for formation movement and regrouping, alongside essential **UI elements** for speed and pause.
